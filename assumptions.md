# Null Hypothesis: 
1. The voting behavior for the 2025 ESC follows a similar pattern to previous post-covid ESC entries (including 2022). 
2. The differences between the 2025 polling and final results can be accounted for through statistical error from either: biased selection of polling respondents or statistically insignificant polling data. 

# Assumptions For The Analysis
1. Pre-ESC polling has not been tampered with, the numbers accurately represent the polling results.
2. Pre-ESC polling represents public sentiment among big fans of the contest, but not necessarily the general public.
3. Televoters from Australia are more representative of the "big Eurovision fans" as detailed in assumption 2. This is because of differing time zones, forcing the viewers to put in significant effort to watch the ESC live. 

# Limitations For The Analysis
* I will only analyze the televote as the jury vote is famously unreliable and not representative of public sentiment.
* I will have to account for selection bias in pre-ESC polling.
* The way the points system is set up makes it very difficult to accurately approximate the number of votes or the shares of these awarded to each country. 

## Significant Limitation: No quantitative voting data available
* Requires inference for the exact votes in each country.
* Pre-esc polling should (!) to some extent be representative of voting shares, i.e. if a country gets 2% of the pre-esc polling votes but 40% of the votes during the night, this should have a qualitative explanation (ex, ESC 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine).

### This analysis would have been a lot easier to make if the EBU released (anonymous) voting results per country to the public. 
Data that should be included here is just the number of votes within a country to each other country (in absolute numbers, not as a share of total vote).

## Data Limited to post-covid (2021-2025), as going too far back can introduce bias from a more stable geopolitical situation.
